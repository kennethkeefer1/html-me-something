                                        <h2>Hilt</h2>
                                            <h4>The style and structure of a lightsaber hilt often shows off the owner's personality as much as it does follow its function and usage. These are the common variants of lightsaber hilts.</h4>
                                            <a name="Standard"></a>
                                            <h3>Standard</h3>
                                                <p>The single standard hilt is the most frequently used of all hilt variants. It is able to adapt to most styles of lightsaber combat. Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke Skywalker are examples of standard hilt users.</p>
                                                <a name="Shoto"></a>
                                            <h3>Shoto</h3>
                                                <p>For those looking for a lightsaber more relative to a diminutive size, the shoto style lightsaber is useful. It also is a handy compliment to a primary standard lightsaber for those wishing for the ability to dual wield with the Jar'Kai style. Yoda is a well known user.</p>
                                                <a name="Dual"></a>
                                            <h3>Dual Blade</h3>
                                                <p>Twice the blades is twice the attack for those looking to wield a double bladed lightsaber. With proper training on this weapon, it is as dangerous to the wielder as to an opponent. Used by Darth Maul.  </p>                          
                                                <a name="Curved"></a>
                                            <h3>Curved Hilt</h3>
                                                <p>Allowing its wielder added precision and speed in attack, the curved hilt fits best for those that respect the dance of a dual more than the violence. Choice of former Jedi turned Sith, Count Dooku.</p>
